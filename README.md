This repository contains code to implement the methodology discussed in 'Sequential Estimation of Temporally Evolving Latent Space Network Models' 
by Kathryn Turnbull, Christopher Nemeth, Matthew Nunes and Tyler McCormick. A preprint of this paper is available on arxiv, with reference arXiv:2112.10220.

The folder 'SMCcode' contains functions requires to implement the methods, and the folder 'RunSMCcode' provides scripts to run the simulations from the 
article. The folder 'data' provides a script to process the classroom contacts data example, and the raw data are available at
